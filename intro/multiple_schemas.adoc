=== Multiple Schemas ===
The **CommsDSL** also allows definition of multiple protocols with different schema
names. The rules described in previous <<intro-multiple-files, Multiple Files>> section
still apply. The first file that introduces a schema with a specific name must define all
the properties that cannot be overridden by other files defining a **&lt;schema&gt;** node
with the same **name**.

For example, the following definitions with different properties are allowed because they define different protocols:

First processed file:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="Prot1" endian="big" version="2">
    ...
</schema>
----
Second processed file:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="Prot2" endian="little" version="1">
    ...
</schema>
----

Any other **&lt;schema&gt;** node in the subsequent file(s) must not change any of the relevant
properties in case other **&lt;schema&gt;** node with the same **name** has already been processed before.

Third processed file:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="Prot1">
    <!-- No properties have been overridden -->
    ...
</schema>
----
